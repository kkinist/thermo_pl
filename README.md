Unfortunately, the online service has not been working for years, due to a change in website CMS software and security policies. If you have the Perl language available on your computer, you can run the file "thermo.pl" on your own computer.  The program "thermo.pl" is available in this repository or at the bottom of the webpage cited above. 

The Windows operating system does not include Perl.  If your computer is on Windows, and you don't want to install Perl, try the file "thermo.exe" available here in this 
repository. It was generated from "thermo.pl" using a conversion utility.
